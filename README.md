#  Low-Code Script Generator Platform (Alpha)

Welcome! 

This project is an **early-stage low-code script generator platform** designed to help IT professionals and MSPs automate repetitive tasks with ease.  
Inspired by **CIPP** and **Power Automate**, the goal is to simplify IT automation by **generating scripts and running Graph API calls** without requiring deep coding knowledge.

## About the Project
The platform focuses on making automation **accessible, customizable, and secure**.  

### Features (Planned & In Progress)
- Generate scripts for **PowerShell** and **macOS Shell**  
- Build and manage **Conditional Access Policies**  
- Deploy **Intune templates** for device configuration and compliance  
- Provide a **low-code/no-code interface** to manage automation flows  
- Enable sharing and reusing script templates across environments  
- Automate **user and device onboarding/offboarding** with Microsoft Graph API  

###Vision
The long-term vision is to build a **community-driven automation hub** where IT admins can:  
- Share and customize script templates for cross-platform environments  
- Automate **security, compliance, and device management policies**  
- Run everything securely in their own tenant without exposing credentials
